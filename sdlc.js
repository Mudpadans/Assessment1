// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

/*
1. Planning
2. Analysis of Requirements
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing & Integration
6. Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the step where teams examine what is needed in order to execute the plan and then gather the resources accordingly, variables such as user experience and database structures.."
const design = "Here, developers, or designers specifically, conceptualize and map out what the product will look and how it should behave."
const implementation = "This is where developers will start the coding, following everything that the design demands to make it functional."
const testingAndIntegration = "After the code is built, bugs and errors in code would be found here and should be adjusted to improve it before sending it out."
const maintain = "Once the software is out, bugs will need to be patched away to sustain the code, this can include more features and functions being implemented."
